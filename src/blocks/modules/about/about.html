          Your Airbnb profile should be&nbsp;personable but also professional.
          Think somewhere between a&nbsp;dating profile and your resume; enough
          personal information to&nbsp;let guests know you&rsquo;re a&nbsp;real
          person but professional enough to&nbsp;show you care about your
          property and will handle your guests in&nbsp;a&nbsp;professional
          manner. It&nbsp;should show you take your rental property seriously
          and strive to&nbsp;provide quality accommodations. <br />
          Some of&nbsp;the best Airbnb hosts don&rsquo;t take the time
          to&nbsp;write a&nbsp;profile but it&rsquo;s such an&nbsp;easy and
          simple way to&nbsp;elevate all your listings. Even superhosts would
          benefit from a&nbsp;well-written profile.
